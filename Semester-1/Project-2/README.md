# Adjacency Matrix Graph Representation  ## Description  This is a **basic C program** that generates a **random directed graph** using an **adjacency matrix representation**. The program:  - Takes the number of **vertices (n)** as input.  - Generates a **random adjacency matrix** where each edge is randomly assigned a value of **0 or 1**.  - Computes the **sum of in-degrees** and **sum of out-degrees** of all vertices.  - Measures the **computational time** required to perform these operations.  This is **not an advanced program**, but rather a **simple implementation** used for learning structured programming and graph representation concepts.  ---## How It Works  1. **User Input**: Enter the number of vertices `n`.  2. **Graph Generation**: A **random adjacency matrix** is created where:     - `1` represents a directed edge.     - `0` means no edge.  3. **Display Matrix**: The generated adjacency matrix is printed.  4. **Degree Calculation**:     - **In-degree**: The number of edges coming **into** a vertex.     - **Out-degree**: The number of edges going **out** of a vertex.  5. **Performance Measurement**: The execution time is measured and displayed in **milliseconds**.  ---## Sample Output  ```Enter vertices: 4  0 1 0 1  1 0 1 0  0 1 0 1  1 0 1 0  Sum of In Degree is = 6  and Sum of Out Degree is = 6  Computational time of this function: 0.25 milliseconds  ```---## Compilation and Execution  To compile and run the program:  ```shgcc graph.c -o graph  ./graph  ```Replace `graph.c` with your actual filename if different.  ---## Notes  - **Time Complexity**: `O(nÂ²)`, as it iterates through the adjacency matrix twice.  - The adjacency matrix is stored in a **2D array of size `n x n`**, which can be memory-intensive for large `n`.  - Suitable for small to moderate graph sizes due to space complexity limitations.  ---## Author  **A S M SAYEM**  This program was created as part of a **Discrete Mathematics** course to demonstrate basic graph operations and adjacency matrix representation.
